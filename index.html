In particular, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Templeman Review</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to amplify the voices of undergraduates who would otherwise not have had the opportunity to have been published. Submissions from postgraduates and non-students will also be considered. We offer no guidelines concerning length or style. All submissions should be original, and we cannot accept submissions that have been previously published. We allow simultaneous submissions provided you promptly withdraw your work if it is accepted elsewhere.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They should also include a name, and if a student at the University of Kent, a college affiliation. This can be found under 'my record' in the student data system.</span></p>
